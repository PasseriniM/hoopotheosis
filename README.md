# Hoopotheosis

A little game based on a failed submission for the Ludum Dare 47, with the theme "Stuck in a Loop".

You can play the game on [itch.io](https://idle-ideator.itch.io/hoopotheosis).

The game is made with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Every asset was made by me, these include graphics, music, font and, obviously, code.
